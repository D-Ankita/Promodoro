# Typescript-Promodoro-Timer
Typescript Promodoro timer MD is a Simple Promodoro timer . Typescript was used to build this project. This App was developed at the very beginning of learning Typescript.

Pomodoro Timer is a customizable pomodoro timer that works on desktop & mobile browser.

The aim of this app is to boost your productivity.

This app is inspired by [Pomodoro Technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) which is a time management method developed by [Francesco Cirillo](https://francescocirillo.com/products/the-pomodoro-technique).

Plain CSS is used for styling.This project is not complete (as no web app could ever be sufficiently called complete) as we could always enhance the existing feature, fix bugs and add new features. I plan to revisit this project when I want to try something new.
